/*
Print numbers from 1 to N without the help of loops.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 10
Output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

Example 2:

Input:
N = 5
Output: 1 2 3 4 5
 

Your Task:
This is a function problem. You only need to complete the function printNos() that takes N as parameter and prints number from 1 to N recursively. Don't print newline, it will be added by the driver code.


Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N) (Recursive).


Constraints:
1 <= N <= 1000*/

void printNos(int N)
{
    int a = 1;
    label1:
    if(a<=N)
    {
        printf("%d ",a);
        a++;
        goto label1;
    }
}
